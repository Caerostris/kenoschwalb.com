					<h2>Fencing</h2>
					<span>
						I absolutely love fencing. I started when I was eight and I won't quit anytime soon.<br>
						Fencing is a wonderful sport for various reasons. Just like every sport, fencing is endlessly thrilling.<br>
						Most clubs build up a strong feeling of community and watching your clubmates in a competition can be even more nerve-racking than fencing yourself.<br>
						Throughout a hundred competitions I have gone through glorious victories and devastating defeats. Fencing really taught me how to handle defeature.<br>
						<br>
						I've always been relatively successful, achieving ranks between 17 and 41 on the German rankings.<br> Fencing on a high-level competition like the German Championships is a feeling that's impossible to describe. It's just the most wonderful thing in the world :)<br>
						<br>
						In 2012, two friends and I obtained a license for coaching and trained our club's beginners group till fall 2014.<br>
						Being a coach opens up a whole new perspective to fencing. It helps understand why, at times, you are forced to do things that seem to be pointless and forces you to learn how to make decisions quickly (or plan ahead).<br>
						Even though coaching a horde of children can be tedious work after a long day of school, I love teaching people and it's usually still a lot of fun!
