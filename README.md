This repository contains the source code of my personal portfolio website.

## Tech Stuff

Hosting is provided by GitHub Pages.
Source code can be found in the `main` branch.

The website is a single-page application consisiting of just HTML5 and CSS.
Nothing fancy there.

## Build and Deployment

Run `make` in order to build the site.
This will essentially start a shell script which fetches a few thumbnails from Instagram and minifies the CSS code.

Run `make deploy` in order to publish the changes.
